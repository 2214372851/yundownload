# Intro

> This project is a file downloader, supporting dynamic download according to the size of the file to choose the
> download mode, for the connection that supports breakpoint continuation will automatically break the connection, for
> the
> unsupported link will overwrite the previous content, the project includes retry mechanism, etc., currently supports:
> streaming download, large file fragment download.

# Install

`pip install yundownload`

# Stash

[yundownload GitHub](https://github.com/2214372851/yundownload)

# Give an example

```python
from yundownload import YunDownloader, Limit

download = YunDownloader(
  url='https://dldir1.qq.com/qqfile/qq/PCQQ9.7.17/QQ9.7.17.29225.exe',
  limit=Limit(
    max_concurrency=4,
    max_join=4
  ),  # concurrency
  timeout=1000,
  # You are advised to set a longer timeout period for large file fragments because large file fragments exert pressure on the peer server
  dynamic_concurrency=True,
  save_path='QQ9.7.17.29225.exe'
)
# Files larger than this size are downloaded in fragments
download.DISTINGUISH_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024
# The size of each shard at download time
download.CHUNK_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024
# Heartbeat status detection time
download.HEARTBEAT_SLEEP = 1
# Run task. error_retry: Number of retries when an error occurs
download.run(error_retry=3)
```

## Command line tool

> In version 0.1.16, a command line tool was added, which can be used as follows:

```shell
yundownload -h
usage: yundownload [-h] [-mc MAX_CONCURRENCY] [-mj MAX_JOIN] [-t TIMEOUT] [-r RETRY] [--stream] url save_path

Yun Downloader

positional arguments:
  url                   Download url
  save_path             Save path, including file name

options:

  -mc MAX_CONCURRENCY, --max_concurrency MAX_CONCURRENCY
                        Maximum concurrency
  -mj MAX_JOIN, --max_join MAX_JOIN

  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Timeout period
  -r RETRY, --retry RETRY
